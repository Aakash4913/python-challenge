# python-challenge


In this challenge, I took a CSV of a budget from month to month and 
calculuated the total profits and total amount of months in the csv.  
I then calculated average change from month to month and found the 
month where the biggest increase and decrease in profits were and which
month they happened.


Next I looked at poll data for a rural town, and modernized its vote counting.
Now the town will be able to see the total votes and the voteshare.  The project 
also displays the winner after all votes have been counted.
